### soundAlert-soundAnalyzer ESP32
 Alert system by frequency sound with sound analyzing tools. Made for Wifi Kit 32 V3 (ESP32)

# Alert detector / Sound Analyzer Wifi Kit32

Description
The Sound Analyzer Wifi Kit32 is a program that utilizes Arduino and various libraries to create a sound alert system. The main functionality of the code is to detect specific frequencies with certain intensities and display corresponding alerts on an OLED display.

## Hardware

The following hardware components are used in the system:

- Microcontroller Board: Heltec Wifi Kit 32 V3
- Microphone: Max9814
- Battery Holder: AAA Battery Holder
- Case: 3D printed case

## Dependencies

The program requires the following libraries:

- Arduino libraries
- SPI
- Wire
- Driver RTC IO (ESP32)
- Adafruit SSD1306 OLED display library
- Math
- Complex

## Functionality

The program consists of the following sections:

- Hardware configuration: This section includes the configuration of the microcontroller board and microphone.
- Display initialization: The OLED display is initialized in this section.
- Sound analysis tools: The program performs fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis on the captured sound data to identify specific frequencies and intensity thresholds.
- Main loop functionality: The system continuously captures sound, performs analysis, and triggers alerts when detections occur. The corresponding messages are displayed on the OLED screen.

## Note

The complete code includes additional files and libraries that are not shown in this documentation.
