 * @brief Sound Alert System
 *
 * Program: Sound Alert System
 * Description: This program utilizes Arduino and various libraries to create a sound alert
 * system. The main functionality of the code is to detect specific frequencies with
 * certain intensities and display corresponding alerts on an OLED display.
 * 
 * Hardware:
 * - Microcontroller Board: Heltec Wifi Kit 32 V3
 * - Microphone: Max9814
 * - Battery Holder: AAA Battery Holder
 * - Case: 3D printed case
 *
 * The program includes different sections for hardware configuration, display
 * initialization, sound analysis tools, and the main loop functionality. It utilizes the
 * Arduino IDE and libraries such as SPI, Wire, FFT algorithms, and the SSD1306 OLED display
 * library.
 *
 * The system continuously captures sound through the Max9814 microphone, performs fast
 * Fourier transform (FFT) analysis on the sound data, and checks for specific frequencies
 * and intensity thresholds. When a detection occurs, an alert is triggered, and the
 * corresponding message is displayed on the OLED screen.
 *
 * Note: The complete code includes additional files and libraries that are not shown in
 * this snippet.
